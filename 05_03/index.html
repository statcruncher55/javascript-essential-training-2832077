    Hello, I'm Amanda Barreto-Anez, a junior majoring in Public Administration and minoring in Spanish and Social Entrepreneurship & Non-Profit Management. Although I have not
    previously held a position in the SGA, my executive membership in the Latino Student Organization and Resident Assistant role have helped me develop the leadership and
    communication skills necessary for the position of SGA Senator representing the Arts & Sciences School. If elected, I plan to champion diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts
    on campus, working with fellow students and university administration to address concerns and foster community within the campus. My experience in facilitating communication
    and collaboration among diverse groups will enable me to effectively represent the needs and interests of my peers. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to serve as an SGA
    Senator, and I believe that my background, skills, and commitment make me an excellent candidate for the position.

    Hello, my name is Caleb New. I am a Sophomore History major. I have not yet participated in SGA, but would love the opportunity to serve my peers by bringing a fresh
    perspective to Senate. I served as a Connections leader this year and it was one of the most rewarding experiences I have had in my time at Samford because I was able to give
    back all the attention and care to the incoming students that I was given as a Freshman. If elected, I intend to take this same attitude to SGA senate. I have taken time to
    speak with friends currently in senate to understand the position, and I believe I could use this role to bring students' concerns to the floor and effectuate change. If
    elected, I will listen to the changes the student body desires and do all I can to accomplish them.

    I am Connor Watson, a sophomore political science major and University Fellow. Last year, I was a member of Freshman Forum and the Samford Gives Back executive leadership team.
    This year, I have served on the Student Senate as chair of the Academic Affairs Committee. In this position, I have had the opportunity to advocate for and solve student
    concerns across a variety of areas, including with technology services and access to study spaces. My primary goal this year has been advocating for the university helping to
    pay for quizlet plus for students, a goal I will continue to pursue if re-elected. I am running for re-election because I love Samford and want to do everything I can to make
    it a better place to live and study. If re-elected, I will continue to put the needs of my constituents first with ideas based, Christ centered, and service oriented
    leadership.

    I'm a Junior Psychology major from Hendersonville, Tennessee. This is my first time running for anything, but I'm no stranger to student government. I've been putting in the
    work this past year, learning how everything runs so I can best serve the student body. With your vote, I hope to make the campus more inclusive for all students, particularly
    for those with unique backgrounds that may need specific accommodations on campus. As a member of the autistic community myself, I am uniquely qualified for this platform, and
    I want to use my experience and my passion to make Samford the best campus it can be for everyone who calls it home.

    My name is Emma Murphree, and I am a sophomore Psychology major. While I have not yet had a chance to be involved in SGA here at Samford, I have past experience with SGA in
    high school. I served as a class representative for many years and Senior Class Treasurer. I was able to lead by working with other class officers to plan events and enhance
    our high school experience. Other leadership positions I hold on campus include serving as the Community Service Specialist for Alpha Delta Pi sorority and the Samford Gives
    Back 2023 Leadership Team President. I am qualified for this position because I am ambitious, reliable, and servant-hearted. If I am elected to this position, I will strive to
    lead with humility and advocate for the best interests of the Howard College of Arts and Sciences students, as well as the Samford student body as a whole.

    I am currently a sophomore, studying Spanish. I have represented the Howard College of Arts and Sciences in SGA Senate and was previously a member of Freshman Forum. While
    Co-Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, I have had the privilege of helping multiple Student Organizations gain access to funding and presented various funding bills on the
    Senate floor. I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to represent Samford students and advocate on their behalf. If re-elected, I will continue to serve to the best of my ability
    and prioritize offering Student Organizations as much beneficial guidance as possible.

    Hey!! I’m Erin Wojcik and I’m a freshman from Franklin, Tennessee! I’m an engineering major here at Samford with the career goal of manufacturing medical devices. I am
    currently part of Freshman Forum which has made me want to continue SGA next year. I haven’t made any notable accomplishments here yet, but I hope to make some if I get the
    privilege to serve on Senate next year. One of the other reasons I would love to serve is to represent the physics department as we are not represented well enough. There are
    many people who did not even know we existed until I told them, and I would love to be a part in helping the department grow. My goal in senate is to give our department a
    voice and to get more funding for SPS (Society of Physics) as we are losing many crucial members in our department next year. In my four years at Samford, I want to see the
    physics/engineering department flourish and even help recruit more people to join. I want to be able to leave Samford having made an impact
